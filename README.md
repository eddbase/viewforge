# ViewForge

ViewForge is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed for defining and managing **computational pipelines** over various data sources. It offers a structured and declarative approach that abstracts away the complexities of workflow construction and management.

## ðŸ’¬ About the DSL

The ViewForge DSL enables users to:

- Define data sources
- Apply transformation steps
- Select appropriate execution engines
- Specify computation mode (real-time or batch)

Its design promotes simplicity and expressiveness, making it suitable for both exploratory data flows and production pipelines.
